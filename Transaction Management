Transactions
A transaction is a logical, atomic unit of work that contains one or more SQL statements.
The basic principle of a transaction is "all or nothing": an atomic operation succeeds or fails as a whole.

Data Concurrency
Data concurrency is the simultaneous access of the same data by multiple users.
Locks help ensure data integrity while allowing maximum concurrent access to data

Data Consistency
Each user must see a consistent view of the data, including visible changes made by a user's own transactions and committed transactions of other users.
Oracle Database always enforces statement-level read consistency, which guarantees that the data that a single query returns is committed and consistent for a single point in time.
The database can also provide read consistency to all queries in a transaction, known as transaction-level read consistency.
